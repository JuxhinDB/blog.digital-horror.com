# Introduction

> This blog post aims to be high-level enough to allow for a wide audience to provide feedback. There are points which may contain highly technical bits&mdash;these can be glossed over. I will aim to provide the outcome or objective in non-technical terms as well.

One topic that has always been in the back of my mind for a number of years was the state of digital identity in today's world. It always felt perturbing how, given the amount of our life we spend on digital services, we do not truly own any of the data or information that we create. I try to think of a future where this changes entirely; devoid of the incompatible security models of today.

Rather than thinking about the problem technically, I prefer draawing parallels to the real (physical) world that we live in and see if the current security and identity model works. Let us take a seemingly inoculous scenario&mdash;Andy needs to buy a screwdriver kit to repair a few gadgets at home. Currently Andy has two non-exhaustive options.

1. Go on to Amazon to place the order online and hopefully retrieve it on the same day.
2. Head over to the local ironmonger or hardware store and immediately.

## Scenario 1 &mdash; Purchasing online

Andy has to login to Amazon using their username and password. After logging in they need to search for the item they are looking for, likely losing track by looking at an infinite number of items they _totally_ do not need. Finally after finding the screwdriver kit, they add it to their digital basket and finalise the payment. 


## Scenario 2 &mdash; Purchasing in person

Andy walks to the hardware store unannounced and tries to look for the  screwdriver kit, likely losing track by looking at an infinite number of items they _totally_ do not need. Finally after finding the screwdriver kit, they head to the counter and finalise the payment. For the sake of illustration let us assume they paid in cash.

## Problem

# Importance of identity

_Talk about civilisation and identity crisis_

# Current design (i.e. SSO/OAuth/OpenID)

> The argument does not aim to criticise the OAuth2/OpenID framework. I think they were good technologies that enabled this interoperability and sense of identity for its time. I just don't feel it enabled it in the right direction.

# Personal proposition

## Presentation-based Identity

## Deferring capabilities

## Data ownership

# Conclusion

This is the first time I'm openly writing about these thought, I'm doing so in hopes that I can get some feedback, thoughts and recommendations around this idea and topic.
