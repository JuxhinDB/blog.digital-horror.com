<h2><a href="#abstract" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="header-abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p>Denial-of-Service (DOS) attacks stem all the way from the early 1970s till today, causing excessive damage to organizations across the world. The following blog post goes through the thought and development of a specific DOS attack known as the TCP SYN flood, written in Rust and powered by <a href="https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet">libpnet</a>. The tool itself is still a Work in Progress (WIP) however it's enough to share my experience with low-level networking in Rust.</p>
<h2><a href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="header-introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The tool was named, &quot;Synner&quot;—because it sends SYN packets in rapid succession to a target in order to cause a Denial of Service, which is effectively a crime and a sinful act.. You be the judge.</p>
<p>Open-sourcing and writing about certain tools such as a TCP SYN flooder is often frowned upon in the infosec community. I don't mind that. I believe we should be well aware of certain attacks, in order to effectively defend ourselves against them.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I currently work as a developer at a web security company and one of my tasks is related to the maintenance and development of what is effectively, a glorified open DNS resolver with some quirks and hacks.</p>
<p>After being bombarded a couple of times with traffic spikes exceeding 5000% of the normal packet intake on a particular interface, I decided to do some further digging. To cut the story short, I ended my research feeling smart and proud, going to management with a fat headline that screamed</p>
<p><em>We are under a TCP SYN flood attack (!)</em></p>
<p>Eyebrows were raised, concerns were voiced; until one of the management team members promptly asked, &quot;but if this is through DNS, then we're looking at UDP packets and not TCP (by default)&quot; which was indeed true. Turns out, it had nothing to do with SYN floods, nor TCP for that matter. What was I thinking?</p>
<p>I was very wrong, and I threw a dangerous headline out there that could've sent us down a deep rabbit hole. So I swallowed my humble pill and decided that in order to truly make up for it, I must really understand what a TCP SYN flood attack is, by building a tool that does just that.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-is-a-tcp-syn-flood" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="header-what-is-a-tcp-syn-flood"></a>What is a TCP SYN flood</h2>
<p>TCP SYN flood leverages the TCP three-way handshake (<code>SYN</code> -&gt; <code>SYN/ACK</code> -&gt; <code>ACK</code>) which is effectively three packets in the following order.</p>
<p><img src="../res/synner--a-tcp-syn-client-written-in-rust/tcp_normal.png" alt="TCP handshake" />
(<em>Image courtesy of Wikipedia at</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood</a>)</p>
<p>The exception being that it is tuned to only send SYN packets (Synchronize). The idea here, is that such an operation is cheap for the transmitter (us) to transmit, however more expensive for the receiver (target) to receive and allocate resources to. More so, when sending the SYN packet, we don't wait until we receive a SYN/ACK back (like a normal client would), we just continue transmitting more SYN packets for the server to handle. As a result, when a legitimate user tries to connect to the server, the server will be bottlenecked with a queue of SYN connections it already has to handle.</p>

(<em>Image courtesy of Wikipedia at</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood</a>)</p>
<p>Another troublesome concern for the receiver, is that the source (from now on src) can be spoofed, especially the src port. Making it rather difficult to pinpoint and block.</p>
<p>A random TCP SYN packet as a hex dump would look as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-none">0000   08 00 27 cb 9d 0b 48 4d 7e 9c 79 4b 08 00 45 00   ..'Ë..HM~.yK..E.

<p>Which when broken down may look something along the lines of.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hex">0x08, 0x00, 0x27, 0xcb, 0x9d, 0x0b,	// Destination MAC

<p>That took longer than you think to write down and figure out.</p>
<h2><a href="#building-the-tool" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="header-building-the-tool"></a>Building the Tool</h2>
<p>Being a newbie in Rust, and low-level networking in general, there was a lot to learn. This is where I truly saw <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">WireShark</a> shine. The ability to see any network traffic coming out of an interface, even if <em>malformed</em>, and analyzed, was priceless here. There were three key points I needed to achieve.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to select a specific Windows interface to bind a channel to</li>
<li>Ability to send a packet through that channel</li>
<li>Confirm that the packet was received by the target</li>
</ol>
<p>Starting with number 1, libpnet has a wrapper function call in its <code>pnet_datalink</code> library called <code>interfaces()</code>. This was exactly what I needed. So I plonked a bit of code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let interface = &quot;\\DEVICE\\FOO&quot;;
let interfaces = pnet_datalink::interfaces();


let interfaces_name_match = |iface: &amp;NetworkInterface| iface.name == interface;
let interface = interfaces
    .into_iter()
    .filter(interfaces_name_match)
    .next()

    .unwrap();
</code></pre>
<p>..which unfortunately panicked, due to the initial buffer size being too small.</p>
<p>Turns out, unlike Unix's simple and elegant <code>eth0</code>, <code>eth1</code> and so on, Windows likes to be a tad more verbose with something like <code>\Device\NPF_{927C716F-3AD0-42D6-89A1-0B121C6F5413}</code>. So I submitted a short <a href="https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet/pull/330">PR</a> to libpnet and merged it to master to fix this.</p>
<p>Try again, and it worked (only after an hour to notice Command Prompt had to be running in Administrator mode ofcourse). I can now create an Ethernet <a href="https://docs.rs/pnet_datalink/0.20.0/pnet_datalink/enum.Channel.html"><code>channel</code></a> and use it as a data transmitter, like so.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let interface = &quot;\\DEVICE\\FOO&quot;;
let interfaces = pnet_datalink::interfaces();


let interfaces_name_match = |iface: &amp;NetworkInterface| iface.name == interface;
let interface = interfaces
    .into_iter()
    .filter(interfaces_name_match)

    .next()
    .unwrap();
    
let (mut tx, _) = match pnet_datalink::channel(&amp;interface, Default::default()) {
    Ok(Channel::Ethernet(tx, rx)) =&gt; (tx, rx),
    Ok(_) =&gt; panic!(&quot;Unknown channel type&quot;),
    Err(e) =&gt; panic!(&quot;Error happened {}&quot;, e),
};    
</code></pre>
<p>Moving over to number 2, I had no clue how to build a TCP SYN packet and Google wasn't really helpful. So I went to WireShark to extract a random SYN packet using the filter <code>tcp.flags.syn==1</code> &amp;&amp; <code>tcp.flags.ack==0</code> and found one packet to mimic</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Unfortunately these images have been lost in time. If demanded, I can attempt to recreate them</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which I converted into a u8 vector and sent via the transmitter, like so (appending to earlier code).</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let tmp: [u8; 66] = [0, 144, 127, 152, 18, 225, 72, 
                        77, 126, 156, 121, 75, 8, 0, 69, 
                        0, 0, 52, 60, 138, 64, 0, 128, 
                        6, 241, 127, 172, 18, 130, 68, 
                        216, 58, 198, 40, 250, 227, 1, 
                        187, 84, 35, 54, 201, 0, 0, 0, 
                        0, 128, 2, 250, 240, 31, 218, 0, 
                        0, 2, 4, 5, 180, 1, 3, 3, 8, 1, 
                        1, 4, 2];

tx.send_to(&amp;tmp, None);
</code></pre>
<p>And away she went. No hiccups whatsoever, the packet was sent through the interface and could be seen in WireShark. I can remember this moment vividly and thought to myself, &quot;I can actually make this happen&quot;. This however was just the start. There were (and are) still a few hurdles to overcome.</p>
<h2><a href="#networking-and-receiving-packets" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="header-networking-and-receiving-packets"></a>Networking and Receiving Packets</h2>
<p>There were a few things that I scratched my head with. First of all, if you take a look at the above hexdump that we originally showed, the Ethernet header must include the src and dst MAC addresses for the header to be complete. How on Earth was I going to pull the MAC address of a remote IP that I never spoke to?</p>
<p>Here comes Address Resolution Protocol (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol">ARP</a>). This protocol resides in the Link Layer of the OSI stack and allows us to map an IP address to a MAC address (or other way round, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Address_Resolution_Protocol">RARP</a>). Since we don't know who the remote IP is, we broadcast an ARP packet to our default gateway (router) for some more information and the rest is... well I don't know yet. I won't be diving in this part too much as I don't quite understand it to the degree that I'm comfortable with. If someone actually reads to this point and knows the answer, please do tell me. That said, assume we now magically know the remote interface's MAC address.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong> — Reddit user /u/benjumanji helped explain this much better in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/8xoq9p/synnera_tcp_syn_client_written_in_rust/">/r/rust</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You only need the routers MAC address, not the MAC of the remote.  That's how routing works. I set my dst ip to head off to where it needs  to and the MAC to that of the router (unless the IP is on the same  network then I can send the packet directly, no router required). The  packet is delivered to the router which figures the next hop MAC and  overwrites and the dance continues and eventually your packet will hit a  router that is on the same network as the actual target ip at which  point the ever changing MAC will be overwritten to the actual  destination MAC and your packet will be delivered.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The issues I was mostly experiencing at this point were primarily revolving around.</p>
<p>A. Me sending a packet over an interface that could not communicate  with my target's (VM) interface due to being on a different subnet  entirely.
B. Me not randomizing the <code>tcp.se</code>q field and the <code>tcp.srcport</code> field. This was causing WireShark to complain about some obscure errors,  mostly around the fact that I am trying to send the same TCP packet over  and over again, like so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Unfortunately these images have been lost in time. If demanded, I can attempt to recreate them</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which when changing the <code>MutableTcpPacket.set_sequence()</code>, <code>MutableTcpPacket.set_source()</code> and <code>MutableTcpPacket.set_destination()</code> from:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">tcp_header.set_source(5555);
tcp_header.set_destination(443);
tcp_header.set_sequence(0);
</code></pre>
<p>To:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">tcp_header.set_source(rand::random::&lt;u16&gt;());
tcp_header.set_destination(rand::random::&lt;u16&gt;());
tcp_header.set_sequence(rand::random::&lt;u32&gt;());
</code></pre>
<p>Solved the issue of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retransmitting the same packet (due to the sequence number being the same).</li>
<li>Transmitting multiple SYN connections to the same dst port using the same src port which were allocated by a previous packet.</li>
</ul>
<p>A. was just a matter of figuring out which interface to use to send the packet to. Which brought us to our last point, confirming that the packet  arrived to our target destination in one piece (Don't Fragment pun). To  confirm this I used tcpdump with some filters to extract out SYN packets only:</p>
<pre><code class="language-none">vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ sudo tcpdump  &quot;tcp[tcpflags] &amp; (tcp-syn) != 0&quot; -i eth1 -n
listening on eth1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
11:35:30.828589 IP 192.168.33.1.34191 &gt; 192.168.33.10.7626: Flags [S], seq 05323716, win 64240, options [wscale 8,sackOK,mss 1460,nop,nop,eol]
11:35:30.828621 IP 192.168.33.1.62172 &gt; 192.168.33.10.529: Flags [S], seq 299760578, win 64240, options [wscale 8,sackOK,mss 1460,nop,nop,eol]
</code></pre>
<p>Looking good, we can see some of the packet being reflected in there, such as the TCP Options, <code>nop</code>, <code>nop</code>, <code>eol</code> mapping to <code>0x1, 0x1, 00</code> at the end of the packet. Additionally the TCP source ports are randomized as can be seen between <code>34191</code> and <code>62172</code>.</p>
<h3><a href="#how-fast-is-it" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="header-how-fast-is-it"></a>How fast is it?</h3>
<p>Pretty slow. My implementation in fact is super slow for multiple reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not using any compiler optimizations;</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://docs.rs/pnet_datalink/0.21.0/pnet_datalink/trait.DataLinkSender.html"><code>pnet_datalink::DataLinkSender::send_to instead</code></a> of <code>pnet_datalink::DataLinkSender::build_and_send</code> which means that internally I'm performing a clone on each packet which is far from ideal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, with the current poor implementation, we are looking at 1,000,000 TCP SYN packets being sent in 29.48 seconds, or rather 33,921 packets per second. Not exactly breathtaking.</p>

<p>Lastly which brings me to the last part of my post, regarding Rust. Ofcourse it may come off as hipster or act as a clickbait title but there are multiple reasons I chose Rust.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coming from a Python &amp; Java heavy background, I want to learn and love memory management. The sense of control over your machine's memory is wonderful.</li>

<p>Keep an eye out for the header offsets, they are key to building the packet correctly. Also notice how certain stuff (like IPs) are hardcoded in there.</p>
<p>If you want to get this to work, you need to configure the Ethernet dst and src to point to your interface's MAC address and the target interface MAC address. You also need to configure the hardcoded source IP from <code>192.168.33.1</code> to your own IP. Make sure the target IP is on the same subnet. I explained it in more detail in the following <a href="https://github.com/JuxhinDB/synner/issues/1">issue</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="header-conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, this took me a few weeks of picking it up and putting down, multiple times. I'm nowhere near proficient in low level networking nor Rust however it's something I enjoyed documenting considering I was going to drop this project altogether.</p>
<p>From here I'll continue tinkering with the tool which you can follow <a href="https://github.com/JuxhinDB/synner">here</a> in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the source IP correctly and hopefully automatically from the interface</li>
<li>Perform the ARP lookup to retrieve the remote MAC address prior to sending TCP packet</li>
<li>An all round better command line interface</li>
</ul>
