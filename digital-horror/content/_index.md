> Welcome to my blog. I’m Juxhin, an engineer with Maltese 🇲🇹 and Albanian 🇦🇱 roots, deeply embedded in the field of cybersecurity and engineering. My expertise lies in application security, embedded systems, and soft real-time systems. I have been the co-founder [PhishDeck](https://phishdeck.com/) which has since been acquired, the head of engineering at [Exein](https://exein.io/), and the co-author of [Have I Been Squatted?](https://haveibeensquatted.com/).
>
> My passion for engineering extends beyond my professional work. The ingenious designs and complex challenges I observe in avionics, aerospace, and infrastructure serve as a constant source of inspiration for me. Beyond engineering, I'm interested in the business and economic strategies that drive our industries forward. I'm also an avid sports enthusiast, with a particular passion for boxing and motorsport (f1 and rally!).
>
> This blog is my personal space for sharing insights that I gather over time in the world of engineering and technology, leadership, and the various passions that drive me. I'm not very active, however I hope this to be a place for durable ideas, untethered by the fleeting trends of the tech landscape.
