> I love and appreciate any form of engineering—I find it captivating how we are able to achieve what we want, with what we have. From avionics, to aerospace, infrastructure and transport—engineering really sparks my imagination and drives my work. Less obvious is my interest in business, leadership and econommics as well as my love for sports, particularly boxing and motorsport.
